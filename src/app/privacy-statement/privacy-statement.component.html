        <h3>What is Paws?</h3>

        <p>
          Paws is a skill on the Amazon Alexa digital assistant platform that entails building a personalized experience for all students, accessible voice on your phone, personal computer or other personal devices. Students who opt in and consent will have the ability to link their Northeastern account to n-Powered’s platform so that Paws will be able to identify who is seeking information and provide a personalized response for each student. Should you opt in, accessible information will include a student’s individual class schedule, account profile information, Husky Card balance, student account balance, housing assignments and others.
        </p>

        <h3>How is data accessed?</h3>

        <p>
          To enable the skill to work, n-Powered will store your name, NUID, and advisor information which will help Northeastern and n-Powered identify you and provide answers to many of your questions. Sensitive personal information such as social security numbers, passport numbers, or other personally identifiable information will not be transferred or stored anywhere other than in Northeastern’s secure server.
        </p>

        <p>
          All data transmitted from Northeastern Servers will be encrypted with the highest level of security.
        </p>

        <h3>Where does Amazon fit in?</h3>

        <p>
          We use Amazon’s platform to make this work. Amazon stores information about usage that can be purged upon request. According to Amazon’s website, Amazon Web Services (AWS) are GDPR-ready. You can read more about this in the links below. If you have any concerns about this, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@northeastern.edu">privacy@northeastern.edu</a>.

        <h3>How does Paws use your data?</h3>

        <p>
          This data is going to be used to provide you with personalized information when you need it via smart phones and other personal devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          This data is never going to be sold, distributed, or shared with a third party other than the purpose stated above.
        </p>

        <h3>What can you do to protect your data?</h3>

        <p>
          Security is a shared responsibility. While Northeastern and n-Powered will do our part to keep your data secure while it’s in our care, users should be aware of their surroundings when configuring their Paws settings, and using the skill. Once you have opted in and authenticated to Paws, your information will be ready and available for use, and verbal responses may be overheard. This also means that anyone else with access to your device will be able to ask your smart speaker questions about YOU. This may expose your personal information inadvertently. Please use caution when linking Paws to devices that may be available to individuals other than yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>“How do I opt in”</h3>

        <p>
          We will provide options for you to opt in to only the categories of data that you consent to make available to the n-Powered platform for use within Paws.
        </p>

        <h3>“How do I opt out”</h3>

        <p>
          You can update your preferences at any time by going to <a href="http://pawsatnu.com">n-Powered’s Paws website</a>. You will have the option of opting out of this entire application at any time by going back to the opt-in page and selecting the check-box that reads “Opt-out of all”.  Please note that if you opt-out, all your data will be removed from this platform.
        </p>
